## About this project

The AEPAnalytics extension represents the Analytics Adobe Experience Platform SDK that is required for sending mobile interaction data from your app to Adobe Analytics.

## Requirements
- Xcode 11.x
- Swift 5.x

## Installation
These are currently the supported installation options:

### [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)
```ruby
# Podfile
use_frameworks!

# For app development, include all the following pods
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
    pod 'AEPAnalytics'
    pod 'AEPCore'
    pod 'AEPIdentity'
end

# For extension development, include AEPAnalytics and its dependencies
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
    pod 'AEPAnalytics'
    pod 'AEPCore'
end
```

Replace `YOUR_TARGET_NAME` and then, in the `Podfile` directory, type:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

To add the AEPAnalytics Package to your application, from the Xcode menu select:

`File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`

Enter the URL for the AEPAnalytics package repository: `https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-analytics-ios.git`.

When prompted, input a specific version or a range of versions for Version rule.

Alternatively, if your project has a `Package.swift` file, you can add AEPAnalytics directly to your dependencies:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-analytics-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
]
```

### Project Reference

Include `AEPAnalytics.xcodeproj` in the targeted Xcode project and link all necessary libraries to your app target.

### Binaries

Run `make archive` from the root directory to generate `.xcframeworks` for each module under the `build` folder. Drag and drop all `.xcframeworks` to your app target in Xcode.
